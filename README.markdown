## Overview

A module for upgrading Puppet agents. Supports upgrading from Puppet 4+ puppet-agent packages to later versions.

## Module Description

The puppet_agent module installs the Puppet Collection 1 repo (as a default, and on systems that support repositories); migrates configuration required by Puppet to new locations used by puppet-agent; and installs the puppet-agent package, removing the previous Puppet installation.

This module expects Puppet to be installed from packages.

## Setup

### What puppet_agent affects

* Puppet, Facter, Hiera, and MCollective.
* Puppet's SSL directory and puppet.conf.
* MCollective's server.cfg and client.cfg.
* Removes deprecated settings from puppet.conf.
* Updates puppet.conf and server.cfg for behavioral changes in puppet-agent (future parser is now the default, and MCollective has a new varlog location).

### Setup requirements

Your agents must be running Puppet 4+. Agents should already be pointed at a master running Puppet Server 2.1 or greater, and thus successfully applying catalogs compiled with the Puppet 4 language.

### Beginning with puppet_agent

Install the puppet_agent module with `puppet module install puppetlabs-puppet_agent`.

## Usage

Add the class to agents you want to upgrade, specifying the desired puppet-agent version:

~~~puppet
class {'::puppet_agent':
  package_version => '1.7.0',
}
~~~

This will ensure the version `1.7.0` of the puppet-agent package is installed.

## Reference

### Public classes
* [`puppet_agent`](#class-puppetagent)

### Private classes
* `puppet_agent::install`: Installs packages.
* `puppet_agent::install::remove_packages`: For platforms that can't perform in-place upgrades, removes the old packages.
* `puppet_agent::install::remove_packages_osx`: Removes the old packages on Mac OS X.
* `puppet_agent::osfamily::*`: Platform-specific preparation performed before upgrades.
* `puppet_agent::prepare`: Prepares the agent for upgrade.
* `puppet_agent::prepare::package`: Stages packages locally for install, on platforms that can't install from remote packages.
* `puppet_agent::prepare::*`: Prepare various file and ssl configuration.
* `puppet_agent::service`: Ensures the services are running.
* `puppet_agent::windows::install`: Handles Windows package installation.

### Parameters

#### Class: puppet_agent

##### `arch`

The architecture version you wish to install. Defaults to `$::architecture`. This parameter is [ignored](#known-issues) in Windows Server 2003.

##### `collection`

The Puppet Collection to track. Defaults to `PC1`.

##### `is_pe`

Install from Puppet Enterprise repos. Enabled if communicating with a PE master.

##### `manage_repo`

Boolean to determine whether to configure zypper/yum/apt/solaris repositories. Defaults to `true`.
If set to false, it is assumed an internally hosted repository will be used for the installation,
and the native package providers will be used to query pre-configured repos on the host being upgraded.

##### `package_name`

The package to upgrade to, i.e., `puppet-agent`. Currently, the default and only accepted value is `puppet-agent`.

##### `package_version`

The package version to upgrade to.

##### `service_names`

An array of services to start, normally `puppet` and `mcollective`. If the array is empty, no services are started.

##### `source`

Alternate source from which you wish to download the latest version of Puppet. On the Windows operating system this is the absolute path to the MSI file to install, for example:
``` puppet
  source => 'C:/packages/puppet-agent-1.7.0-x64.msi'
```

##### `install_dir`

The directory the puppet agent should be installed to. This is only applicable for Windows operating systems and when upgrading the agent to a new version; it will not cause re-installation of the same version to a new location. This must use backslashes for the path separator, and be an absolute path, for example:
``` puppet
  install_dir => 'D:\Program Files\Puppet Labs'
```

##### `install_options`

An array of additional options to pass when installing puppet-agent. Each option in the array can be either a string or a hash. Each option is automatically quoted when passed to the install command.

With Windows packages, note that file paths in `install_options` must use backslashes. (Since install options are passed directly to the installation command, forward slashes aren't automatically converted like they are in `file` resources.) Backslashes in double-quoted strings _must_ be escaped, while backslashes in single-quoted strings _can_ be escaped. The default value for Windows packages is `REINSTALLMODE="maus"`.

``` puppet
  install_options => ['PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_DOMAIN=ExampleCorp','PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_USER=bob','PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD=password']
```

##### `msi_move_locked_files`

This is only applicable for Windows operating systems. There may be instances where file locks cause unncessary service restarts.  By setting to true, the module will move files prior to installation that are known to cause file locks. By default this is set to false.

``` puppet
  msi_move_locked_files => true
```

## Limitations

Mac OS X Open Source packages are currently not supported.

### Known issues

* In masterless environments, modules installed manually on individual agents cannot be found after upgrading to Puppet 4+. You should reinstall these modules on the agents with `puppet module install`.

In addition, there are several known issues with Windows:

* To upgrade the agent by executing `puppet agent -t` interactively in a console, you must close the console and wait for the upgrade to finish before attempting to use the `puppet` command again.
* MSI installation failures do not produce any error. If the install fails, puppet_agent continues to be applied to the agent. If this happens, you'll need to examine the MSI log file to determine the failure's cause. You can find the location of the log file in the debug output from either a puppet apply or an agent run; the log file name follows the pattern `puppet-<timestamp>-installer.log`.
* On Windows Server 2003, only x86 is supported, and the `arch` parameter is ignored. If you try to force an upgrade to x64, Puppet installs the x86 version with no error message.
* On Windows Server 2003 with Puppet Enterprise, the default download location is unreachable. You can work around this issue by specifying an alternate download URL in the `source` parameter.

Specifically in the 1.2.0 Release:
* For Windows, you must trigger an agent run after upgrading so that Puppet can create the necessary directory structures.

## Development

Puppet, Inc. modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community contributions are essential for keeping them great. We canâ€™t access the huge number of platforms and myriad hardware, software, and deployment configurations that Puppet is intended to serve. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things. For more information, see our [module contribution guide.](https://docs.puppet.com/forge/contributing.html)
